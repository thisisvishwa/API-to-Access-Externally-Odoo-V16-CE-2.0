Developer Guidelines
====================

This document provides guidelines for developers contributing to the Odoo External API Access Module, version 1.0, for Odoo 16 Community Edition.

Adherence to Standards
----------------------

- Follow the Odoo Custom Addons standards and architecture.
- Ensure that the module is compatible with Odoo 16 Community Edition.
- Use the technical name `odoo_external_api_access` consistently across all module components.

Code Organization
-----------------

- Organize code into logical units within the module structure.
- Place models in `odoo_external_api_access/models/`, views in `odoo_external_api_access/views/`, controllers in `odoo_external_api_access/controllers/`, and static resources in `odoo_external_api_access/static/`.
- Use `__init__.py` files to properly initialize Python modules and submodules.

Readability
-----------

- Write clear, understandable code with appropriate comments.
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose.

Shared Dependencies
-------------------

- Use shared dependencies such as `API_DOCUMENTATION_MODEL`, `API_ENDPOINT_MODEL`, `API_HISTORY_MODEL`, and `API_FAVORITES_MODEL` for consistency.
- Refer to shared schemas like `api_documentation_schema`, `api_endpoint_schema`, `api_history_schema`, and `api_favorites_schema` for data structures.

Security
--------

- Integrate with Odoo's security features to control access based on user roles and permissions.
- Implement authentication and authorization checks in controllers and models.

Testing
-------

- Write tests for all functionalities, located in `odoo_external_api_access/tests/`.
- Cover unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
- Use Odoo's testing framework for writing tests.

Documentation
-------------

- Document all methods and classes within the codebase.
- Update the `README.md` file with module overview and basic usage instructions.
- Maintain `doc/` directory with detailed documentation, including `installation.rst`, `configuration.rst`, `usage.rst`, and `changelog.rst`.

Version Control
---------------

- Use Git for version control.
- Commit changes with descriptive messages.
- Follow a consistent branching strategy for feature additions and bug fixes.

Code Reviews
------------

- Submit code for review before merging into the main branch.
- Address feedback from code reviews promptly.

Internationalization
--------------------

- Provide translation files in `odoo_external_api_access/i18n/`.
- Ensure all user-facing text is wrapped in Odoo's translation functions.

By following these guidelines, developers will contribute to a high-quality, maintainable, and consistent codebase for the Odoo External API Access Module.
